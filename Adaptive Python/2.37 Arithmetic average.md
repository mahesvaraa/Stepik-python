# Arithmetic average

Write a program that reads two numbers aa and bb from the keyboard, calculates and outputs to the console the arithmetic average of all numbers from the interval [a; b], which are divided by 3.

In the example below the arithmetic average is calculated for the numbers on the interval [-5; 12]. Total numbers divided by 3 on this interval 6: -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12. Their arithmetic average equals to 4.5 

The program input contains intervals, which always contain at least one number, which is divided by 3.

**Sample Input:**
```
-5
12
```
**Sample Output:**
```
4.5
```
# Solution
```
a, b = int(input()), int(input())
lst_filter = list(filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, range(a, b + 1)))
print(sum(lst_filter) / len(lst_filter))
```
