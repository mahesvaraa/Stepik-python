You should write a program which creates the smallest possible number from the digits of the two given natural numbers,
while maintaining the order of the digits in these given numbers.

**Input data**

Input string contains the two natural numbers, separated by a space. The numbers are greater than zero and less than
10255.

**Output data**

You should output the smallest possible number, described in the problem statement.

```

# Solution

```python
a, b, res = *input().split(), ''
while a and b:
    if a + 'x' < b + 'x':
        res, a = res + a[0], a[1:]
    else:
        res, b = res + b[0], b[1:]
print(res + a + b)
```
