# 2.112 The number of inversions

The number of inversions

First line contains number 1≤n≤10^5, second one — array A[1…n], containing natural numbers not greater than 10^9. You
need to calculate the number of pairs of indices 1≤i<j≤n, for which A[i]>A[j]. (Such pair of elements is called the
inversion. The number of inversion in the array is in some way its measure of random nature: for example, there are no
inversions at all in an array arranged in a nondecreasing order, and in an array, arranged in descending order, each two
elements form an inversion.)

**Sample Input:**

```
5
2 3 9 2 9
```

**Sample Output:**

```
2
```

# Solution

```python
def count_inversion(lst):
    return merge_count_inversion(lst)


def merge_count_inversion(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return lst, 0
    middle = len(lst) // 2
    left, a = merge_count_inversion(lst[:middle])
    right, b = merge_count_inversion(lst[middle:])
    result, c = merge_count_split_inversion(left, right)
    return result, (a + b + c)


def merge_count_split_inversion(left, right):
    result = []
    count = 0
    i, j = 0, 0
    left_len = len(left)
    while i < left_len and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            count += left_len - i
            j += 1
    result += left[i:]
    result += right[j:]
    return result, count


n = input()
print(count_inversion(list(map(int, input().split())))[-1])
```
