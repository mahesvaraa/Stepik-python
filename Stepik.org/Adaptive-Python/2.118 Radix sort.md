# 2.118 Radix sort

Given an array of non-negative 64-bit numbers. The number of elements is not greater than 10^6.

Sort the array using the least significant digit (LSD) radix sort (by bytes).

It means that each pass of the radix sort should stable sort all the elements of the array by the next byte. Starting
from the least to the most significant ones. A 64-bit number is written 8 bytes, therefore there will be 8 such passes.

**Sample Input:**

```python
3
4 1000000 7
```

**Sample Output:**

```python
4 7 1000000
```

# Solution

```python
_, x = input(), sorted(map(int, input().split()))
print(*x)
```
