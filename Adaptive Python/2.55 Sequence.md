# Sequence

Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (the number is repeated as many times, to what it equals to). Input to the program is a positive integer n â€“ the number of the elements of the sequence the program should print. On the output, it is expected to get the sequence of numbers, written in a single line, space-separated.

For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.

**Sample Input:**
```
7
```
**Sample Output:**
```
1 2 2 3 3 3 4
```
# Solution
```
num = int(input())
arr2 = ''.join([f'{i} ' * i for i in range(num + 1)])
print(*arr2.split()[:num])
```
