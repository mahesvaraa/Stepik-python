# MKAD

The length of the Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) is 109 kilometers. Biker Vasya starts from the zero kilometer of MKAD and
drives with a speed of V kilometers per hour. On which mark will he stop after T hours?

**Input data format**

The program gets integers V and T as input. If V > 0, then Vasya moves in a positive direction along MKAD, if the value
of V < 0 – in the negative direction. 0 ≤ T ≤ 1000, -1000 ≤ V ≤ 1000.

**Output data format**

The program should output an integer from 0 to 108 - the mark on which Vasya stops.

**Sample Input 1:**

```
60
2
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
11
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
-1
1
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
108
```

# Solution

```
v, t = int(input()), int(input())
s = v * t
print(s % 109)
```
