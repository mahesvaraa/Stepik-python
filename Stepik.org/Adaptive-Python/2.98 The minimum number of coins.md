# The minimum number of coins

Each square of the rectangular table N \times MN×M contains some number.

Initially the player is located in the top left square.

In one move he is allowed to move to the neighbouring cell either to the right or down (left and upward moves are not
permitted). When passing through a square the player pays that amount of coins, which is written in this square (he must
also pay coins for the first and for the last squares of his path).

You need to find the minimum number of coins, which the player needs to take in order to get to the bottom right corner.

First line has the two numbers N и M — the size of the table (1 ≤ N ≤ 20, 1 ≤ M ≤ 20).
Next go NN lines having MM numbers in each — the number of coins to pass through the corresponding squares (integers
from 0 to 100).

**Sample Input 1:**

```
3 4
1 1 1 1
5 2 2 100
9 4 2 1
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
8
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
1 1
1
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
1
```

# Solution

```
rows, columns = map(int, input().split())
m = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(rows)]

for i in range(1, columns):
    m[0][i] += m[0][i - 1]

for i in range(1, rows):
    m[i][0] += m[i - 1][0]

for r in range(1, rows):
    for c in range(1, columns):
        from1 = m[r - 1][c]
        from2 = m[r][c - 1]
        m[r][c] += min(from1, from2)

print(m[rows - 1][columns - 1])
```
