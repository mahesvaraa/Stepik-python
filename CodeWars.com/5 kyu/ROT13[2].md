How can you tell an extrovert from an introvert at NSA? Va gur ryringbef, gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f fubrf.

I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it? According to Wikipedia,
ROT13 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.

Hint: For this task you're only supposed to substitue characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers etc.

Test examples:

```python
"EBG13 rknzcyr." -->
"ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -->
"Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"
```

# Solution

```python
from string import ascii_lowercase as al, ascii_uppercase as au
def rot13(text):
    al2, au2 = al[13:] + al[:13], au[13:] + au[:13]
    trans_table = str.maketrans(dict(zip(al + au, al2 + au2)))
    return text.translate(trans_table)
```
