# Letters

As input your program receives the three strings – s, a, b, consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.
In a single operation you can exchange all the occurrences of string a in s to the string b.

For example, s = "abab", a = "ab", b = "ba", then after one operation the string s will become "baba", after two operations – "bbaa", and all subsequent operations will not change the string s.

You need to find out after what minimum number of operations the string s will not contain occurrences of the string a, or to find out that it will not happen.

Output a single number – the minimum number of operations, after which the string s will have no occurrences of the string a.

If after any number of operations the string s will still contain the occurrences of a, output Impossible.

**Sample Input 1:**
```
ababa
a
b
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
1
```
**Sample Input 2:**
```
ababa
b
a
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
1
```
**Sample Input 3:**
```
ababa
c
c
```
**Sample Output 3:**
```
0
```
**Sample Input 4:**
```
ababac
c
c
```
**Sample Output 4:**
```
Impossible
```
# Solution
```
s, a, b = [input() for i in range(3)]
cnt = 0
while a in s:
    s = s.replace(a, b)
    cnt += 1
    if cnt == 1000:
        break
if cnt >= 1000:
    print('Impossible')
else:
    print(cnt)
```
