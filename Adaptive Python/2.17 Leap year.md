# Leap year

The problem is to find whether the given year is a leap year.

Just a reminder: leap years are those years, the number of which is either divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400 (for example, the year 2000 is a leap year, but the year 2100 will not be a leap year).

The program should work correctly for the years 1900 ≤ n ≤ 3000.

Output "Leap" (case-sensitive) if the given year is a leap, and "Regular" otherwise.

**Sample Input 1:**
```
2100
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
Regular
```
**Sample Input 2:**
```
2000
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
Leap
```
# Solution
```
year = int(input())
print(['Regular', 'Leap'][year % 400 == 0 or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0)])
```
