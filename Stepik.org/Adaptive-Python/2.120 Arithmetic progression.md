# Arithmetic progression

Given a sequence of natural numbers from the range [1, 2147483647].

Find whether you can represent these numbers as arithmetic progression. You can change the order of numbers in the
sequence, if necessary.

You should write a program to solve this problem.

**Input data**

Input line contains a sequence of natural numbers. The length of the sequence can be from 1 to 100 000. The numbers are
separated by spaces.

**Output data**

The output should contain either «Yes» in the case of positive reply or «No» otherwise.

**Sample Input:**

```
10 30 40 20
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Yes
```

# Solution

```
arr = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
try:
    d = arr[1] - arr[0]
    flag = 'Yes'
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != d:
            flag = 'No'
    print(flag)
except IndexError:
    print('Yes')
```
