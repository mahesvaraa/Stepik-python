# Shape

Write a program, which reads the number of the shape (1 – square, 2 – circle, 3 – triangle, 4 – rhombus) and prints the
text "You have chosen a square" (or circle, or triangle, or rhombus, depending on the number). If it is a number, which
doesn't correspond to any of the listed shapes, the program should output: "There is no such shape!".

Note: output text should exactly match the sample! Including letters case and location of spaces.

**Sample Input:**

```
1
```

**Sample Output:**

```
You have chosen a square
```

# Solution

```
print({'1': 'You have chosen a square',
       '2': 'You have chosen a circle',
       '3': 'You have chosen a triangle',
       '4': 'You have chosen a rhombus'}.get(input(), 'There is no such shape!'))

```
