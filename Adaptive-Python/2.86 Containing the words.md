# Containing the words

Input of the program is a line containing the words separated by a space. The program should output the information of lengths of words in the given line, from the shortest to the longest word (see the example).

A word is a sequence of arbitrary characters surrounded by spaces or line boundaries. Note that punctuation marks also belong to a word.

**Input format:**
A string containing a sequence of Latin characters and punctuation marks, separated by a space.

**Output format:**
For each word length that appears in the original string, you need to specify the number of words with such length in a format:
`length: amount`

Output this information in the order of increasing length.

**Sample Input:**
```
Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit.
```
**Sample Output:**
```
2: 2
4: 2
5: 1
6: 2
8: 1
9: 2
```
# Solution

```
arr2 = list(map(len, input().lower().split()))
[print(f'{j[0]}: {j[1]}') for j in sorted(set([(i, arr2.count(i)) for i in arr2]))]
```
