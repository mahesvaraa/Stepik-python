# Units of measurement

You should write a program that can transform some units of measurement into others.

The following transformations should be supported:

* miles (1 mile = 1609 m),
* yards (1 yard = 0.9144 m),
* feet (1 foot = 30.48 cm),
* inches (1 inch = 2.54 cm),
* kilometres (1 km = 1000 m),
* meters (m),
* centimetres (1 cm = 0.01 m)
* millimetres (1 mm = 0.001 m)

Use the units of measurement specified in the problem description with the exact specified accuracy.

**Input format:**

Single line in the following format:

`<number> <unit_from> in <unit_to>`

For example: if you get the line "15.5 mile in km", then you should transform 15.5 miles into kilometers.

**Output format:**

Real number in scientific format (exponential), with an accuracy of exactly two digits after decimal point.

**Sample Input:**

```
15.5 mile in km
```

**Sample Output:**

```
2.49e+01
```

# Solution

```
num, unit_from, text, unit_to = input().split()
num = float(num)

to_metre = {"mile": 1609, "yard": 0.9144, "foot": 0.3048, "inch": 0.0254, "km": 1000, "cm": 0.01, "mm": 0.001, "m": 1}

res = num * to_metre.get(unit_from) / to_metre.get(unit_to)
print(f'{res:.2e}')
```
