# 2.101 Backpack

Backpack

The first input line contains the integers 1≤W≤10^4 and 1≤n≤300 — the capacity of the backpack and the number of gold
bars. The next line contains nn integers 0≤w_1,…,w_n≤10^5, specifying the weight of these bars. Find the maximum weight
of the gold you can carry in the backpack.

**Sample Input:**

```
10 3
1 4 8
```

**Sample Output:**

```
9
```

# Solution

```python
W, n = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
w = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
ans = [[0] * n for _ in range(W + 1)]
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(W + 1):
        if j >= w[i]:
            ans[j][i] = max(ans[j][i - 1], ans[j - w[i]][i - 1] + w[i])
        else:
            ans[j][i] = ans[j][i - 1]
print(ans[W][n - 1])
