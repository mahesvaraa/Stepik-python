#The interest rate
The interest rate on the deposit is P percent per annum, which are added to the deposit amount after one year. The deposit is X dollars Y cents. Find the size of the deposit in K years.

**Input data format**

Integers P, X, Y, K.

**Output data format**

The program should output two numbers: the size of the deposit in K years in dollars and cents. Fractional parts of cents after a year should be discarded. Recalculation of the deposit amount (discarding the fractional parts of cents) occurs annually.

Note: If you are facing issues with accuracy in this problem â€“ try to solve it using only integer numbers.

# Solution
```
import math

procents, dollars, cents, years = int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input())
summ = dollars * 100 + cents

for i in range(1, years + 1):
    summ = math.floor(summ + summ * procents * 0.01)
print(summ // 100, summ % 100)
