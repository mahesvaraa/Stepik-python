# Contigs
Write a program that reads an integer from the input (a non-negative one), and outputs this number to the console together with a correctly changed word "contig", for example: 1 contig, 5 contigs.

**Sample Input:**
```
5
```
**Sample Output:**

```
5 contigs
```
# Solution
```
n = int(input())
print([f'{n} contig',f'{n} contigs'][n != 1])
```
