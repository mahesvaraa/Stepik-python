# 2.138 Date

Given three numbers in the first line, which correspond to some date – year, month and day. The second line contains a
single number – days, the number of days.

Find the year, month and day of the date, which will come when the number of days, equal to days, will pass from the
initial date.

**Note:**
Use the standard datetime module to solve this problem. You will find it helpful to use the datetime.date class to store
the date and the datetime.timedelta class to add days to the date.
