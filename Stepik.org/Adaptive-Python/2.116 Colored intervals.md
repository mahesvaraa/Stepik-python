# 2.116 Colored intervals

N intervals were colored on the number axis. We know the coordinate of the left and the right ends of each of these
intervals (Li and Ri). Find the sum of the lengths of parts of the number axis, colored evenly in a single layer.

Use merge sort algorithm for sorting.

# Solution

```python
from itertools import chain
from collections import Counter

n = int(input())
arr = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
arr2 = chain.from_iterable(range(*i) for i in arr)
arr3 = sum(1 for i in Counter(arr2).items() if i[1] == 1)
print(arr3)
```
