# Uppercase
Input a single character and change its register. That is, if the lowercase letter has been entered â€“ make it uppercase, and vice versa. Characters that are not Latin ones need to stay unchanged.

**Sample Input:**
```
b
```
**Sample Output:**
```
B
```

# Solution
```
import string

a = input()
if a in string.ascii_letters:
    print(a.swapcase())
else:
    print(a)
```
