# Robot

The robot moves down the office in the Bioinformatics Institute. Recently, students from the programmers group wrote a program for this robot, according to which when robot enters the room, he counts the number of programmers present in this room and says it aloud: "n programmers".

In order for it to sound correctly, for each nn you need to use the correct word ending.

Write a program, reading an integer nn (non-negative one) from the user input, outputting this number together with the correctly changed word "programmer", so that the robot could correctly communicate with people, for example: 1 programmer, 2 programmers, 5 programmers.

There can be many programmers in one room. Make sure that your program works correctly for all the cases until 1000 persons

**Sample Input 1:**
```
5
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
5 programmers
```
**Sample Input 2:**
```
0
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
0 programmers
```
**Sample Input 3:**
```
1
```
**Sample Output 3:**
```
1 programmer
```
**Sample Input 4:**
```
2
```
**Sample Output 4:**
```
2 programmers
```
# Solution

```
n = int(input())
if n == 0 or n >= 2:
    print(n, 'programmers')
else:
    print(n, 'programmer')
```
