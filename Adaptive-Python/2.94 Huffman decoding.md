# 2.94 Huffman decoding

Huffman decoding

Restore the string by its code and the prefix-free code of symbols.

The first line of the input file specifies the two integers k and l separated by a space â€” the amount of various
characters in the string and the size of the resulting encoded string, accordingly. The next k lines contain letter
codes in the "letter: code" format. None of the codes is a prefix of another one. Letters can be listed in any order.
Letters can be only the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet; each of these letters occurs in the string at least
once. Finally, the last line contains an encoded string. The original string and the codes of all the letters are not
empty. The specified code is that a coded string has the minimum possible size.

In the first line of the output file output the string s. It should consist of the lowercase letters of the Latin
alphabet. It is guaranteed that the length of the correct answer does not exceed 10^4 symbols

**Sample Input 1:**

```
1 1
a: 0
0
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
a
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
4 14
a: 0
b: 10
c: 110
d: 111
01001100100111
```

# Solution

```python
n, length = map(int, input().split())
dic, result, temp = {}, [], ''

for i in range(n):
    letter, stroka = input().split(': ')
    dic[letter] = stroka
    
word_decode = input()
arr = sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
max_len = len(max(sorted(dic.values(), reverse=True), key=len))

for i in word_decode:
    temp += i
    for k, v in arr:
        if v == temp:
            result.append(k)
            temp = ''
            break
            
print(''.join(result))
```
