is the average (mean) of the sequence.



Input data format

Given a sequence of integers, ending with number 0. Find the standard deviation of this sequence.

There are at least two numbers in the sequence.The number 0 itself is not included into the sequence and serves as a sign of cessation.

**Sample Input:**
```
1
7
9
0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
4.16333199893
```
# Solution
```
from math import sqrt
a = int(input())
res = []
while a != 0:
    res.append(a)
    a = int(input())    
n = len(res)
s = sum(res) / n
res2 = list(map(lambda x: (x - s) ** 2, res))
result = sqrt(sum(res2) / (n-1))
print(result)
```
