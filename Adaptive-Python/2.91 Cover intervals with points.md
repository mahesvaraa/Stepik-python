# 2.91 Cover intervals with points

Cover intervals with points

Given nn intervals. Find the set of points having the minimum size (cardinality), for which each of the given intervals
contains at least one of the points.

The first line given 1≤n≤100 – number of intervals. Each of the next nn lines contains two 0≤l≤r≤10^9 numbers, setting
the beginning and the end of the interval. Output the minimum size of the set m and the m points themselves. If there
are several such sets, output any of them.

**Sample Input 1:**

```
3
1 3
2 5
3 6
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
1
3 
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
4
4 7
1 3
2 5
5 6
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
2
3 6 
```

# Solution

```python
n = int(input())
arr = []
for i in range(n):
    arr.append(tuple(map(int, input().split())))

arr.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
check = [arr[0][1]]
for i in arr:
    if all([j not in range(i[0],i[1]+1) for j in check]):
        check.append(i[1])
print(len(check))
print(*check)
```
