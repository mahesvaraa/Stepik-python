# 2.113 Points and intervals

Points and intervals

The first line contains the two integers: 1≤n≤50000 and 1≤m≤50000 — the amount of intervals and points on the straight
line, respectively. Next nn lines each contain the two integers a_i and b_i (a_i≤b_i) — the coordinates of interval
ends. The last line contains mm integers — points positions. All coordinates do not exceed 10^8 by absolute value. The
point is considered belonging to the specified interval, if it lies inside this interval or on the interval boundary.
For each of the points output to how many intervals it belongs to, in the order of occurence of these points in the
input.

**Sample Input:**

```
2 3
0 5
7 10
1 6 11
```

**Sample Output:**

```
1 0 0
```

# Solution

```python
n, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

a = []
for i in range(0, n):
    l, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    a.append([l, -1])
    a.append([r, 1])

p = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
for i in range(m):
    a.append([p[i], 0, i])

a.sort()
res = [0] * m
curr = 0
pi = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i][1] == 1:
        curr += -1
    if a[i][1] == -1:
        curr -= -1
    if a[i][1] == 0:
        res[a[i][2]] = curr

print(*res)
```
