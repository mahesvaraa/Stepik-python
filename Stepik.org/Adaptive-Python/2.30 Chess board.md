You are given coordinates of two queens on a chess board. Find out, whether they hit each other or not.

**INPUT**

Four integer numbers x1, y1, x2, y2 are being typed.

**OUTPUT**

Type "YES" (uppercase) if they hit each other or "NO" if the don't.

You may need the function, that calculates the absolute magnitude of the number, here it is:

```
a = abs(a) # writes |a| into 'a' variable
```

**Sample Input 1:**

```
1 1 3 3
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
YES
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
1 1 4 3
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
NO
```

**Sample Input 3:**

```
2 2 5 2
```

**Sample Output 3:**

```
YES
```

# Solution

```
x1, x2, y1, y2 = map(int, input().split())
if x1 == y1 or x2 == y2 or abs(y2 - x2) == abs(y1 - x1):
    print("YES")
else:
    print('NO')
```
