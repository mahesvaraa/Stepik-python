# Almost representative of the majority

Almost representative of the majority

Given the natural integer 1â‰¤nâ‰¤100000 and the sequence of integers 0 â‰¤ a_1, . . ., a_n â‰¤ 10^90
Output 1, is the sequence contains an integer, occurring strictly more than n/3 times, and 0 otherwise.

**Sample Input:**

```
5
2 3 9 1 2
```

**Sample Output:**

```
1
```

# Solution

```

from collections import Counter
n = int(input())
list_values = map(int, input().split())
print(int(max(Counter(list_values).values()) * 3 > int(n)))
```
