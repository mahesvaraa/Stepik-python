# 2.105 Non-increasing subsequence

Non-increasing subsequence

Given nn integers a_i from 1 to n. Your task -− to find the longest non-increasing subsequence of this sequence, i.e.
such sequence of indices  (i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k), such that a_i1 ≥ a_i2 ≥⋯≥a_ik and there is no sequence with the same
properties of length k + 1k+1.

**Input format**

In the first line contains the integer n - the number of elements in the sequence (1≤n≤100000). The next line contains
nn integers from 1 to n − a_i.

**Output format**

On the first line output the length of the sequence k. On the next line output i_1, i_2, ..., i_ki (1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 <
... < i_k ≤ n). If there are several solutions with the optimal length, output any of them.

**Hints for the solution**

Use dynamic programming. This problem should be solved for O(nlogn).

**Sample Input:**

```
5
5 3 4 4 2
```

**Sample Output:**

```
4
1 3 4 5 
```

# Solution

```python
n = int(input())
arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()][::-1]
P = [0] * n
M = [0] * (n + 1)
L = 0
for i in range(n):
    lo = 1
    hi = L
    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        if arr[M[mid]] <= arr[i]:
            lo = mid + 1
        else:
            hi = mid - 1
    newL = lo
    P[i] = M[newL - 1]
    if newL > L:
        M[newL] = i
        L = newL
    elif arr[i] < arr[M[newL]]:
        M[newL] = i
re = [0] * L
k = M[L]

for i in range(L - 1, -1, -1):
    re[i] = n - k
    k = P[k]
print(len(re))
print(*re[::-1])
