# The average value

The average value

Given the sequence of integers, ending with number 0. Find the average value of all elements in this sequence.

The number 0 itself is not included into the sequence and serves just as a sign of cessation.

**Sample Input:**

```
1
7
9
0
```

**Sample Output:**

```
5.66666666667
```

# Solution

```
a, res = int(input()), []
while a != 0:
    res.append(a)
    a = int(input())
print(sum(res) / len(res))
```
