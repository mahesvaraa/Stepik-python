# IP address

In the internet, each computer is assigned a four-byte code (IP address), which is usually written as four numbers, each
of which can take the values from 0 to 255, separated by periods. Below are the examples of the correct IP addresses:
127.0.0.0
192.168.0.1
255.0.255.255

Write a program to determine whether the specified string is a correct IP address.

The program should take a string of arbitrary characters as input. If this string is a correct record of an IP address -
output YES, otherwise - output NO.

Note

In order to convert string to number it is convenient to use the int function, which takes one string as an argument and
returns a number.

**Sample Input:**

```
127.0.0.1
```

**Sample Output:**

```
YES
```

# Solution

```
ip = input()
if ip.count('.') == 3:
    ip = ip.split('.')
    print(['NO', 'YES'][all([i in map(str, range(0, 256)) for i in ip])])
else:
    print('NO')
```
