2.102 Stairs Stairs

Given 1≤n≤100 – number of stairs of the staircase, and the integers -10^4≤a_1,…,a_n≤10^4, which are used to mark the
stairs. Find the maximum sum that can be obtained by going up the stairs from the bottom up (from the zero to the nn-th
stair), each time going up one or two steps.

**Sample Input 1:**

```
2
1 2
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
3
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
2
2 -1
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
1
```

**Sample Input 3:**

```
3
-1 2 1
```

**Sample Output 3:**

```
3
```

# Solution

```python
n = int(input())
steps = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    steps[i] += max(steps[i - 1], steps[i - 2])
print(steps[-1])
```
