# The largest element of the sequence
Given the sequence of integer numbers (which ends with the number 0). Find the largest element of the sequence.

The number 0 itself is not included into the sequence, but serves only as a sign of the end.

Sample Input:
```
1
7
9
0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
9
```
# Solution
```
a, res = int(input()), []
while a != 0:
    res.append(a)
    a = int(input())
print(max(res))
```
