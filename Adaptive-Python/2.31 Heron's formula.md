# Heron's formula

Many years ago when Paul went to school, he did not like the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle, because he considered it very complex. Once he decided to help all school students: to write and distribute the program, calculating the area of a triangle by its three sides.

However, there was a problem: as Paul did not like the formula, he did not memorize it. Help him finish this act of kindness and write the program, calculating the area of a triangle by the transferred length of its sides, in accordance with the Heron's formula:
```
S=sqrt(p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c))
```
where ```p=(a+b+c)/2 ```– half-perimeter of the triangle. On the input, the program has integers, and the output should be a real number corresponding to the area of the triangle.

**Sample Input:**
```
3
4
5
```
**Sample Output:**
```
6.0
```
# Solution
```
a, b, c = int(input()), int(input()), int(input())
p = 0.5 * (a + b + c)
s = (p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c)) ** 0.5
print(s)
```
