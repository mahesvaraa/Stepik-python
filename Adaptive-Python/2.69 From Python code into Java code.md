# From Python code into Java code

You decided to write a converter from Python code into Java code. As CamelCase names are standard in Java, you decided to learn how to convert names from underscore into this format.

First, write a program, which changes variable names from underscore to the UpperCamelCase style.

In the underscore style each word starts from a lowercase letter characterizes, and the underscore character “_” separates the words. In the UpperCamelCase style each word is starts from the capital letter and there are no separators between the words.

**Input format:**

Single string, containing the name, written in the underscore style.

**Output format:**

The string, containing the new name in the UpperCamelCase style.

**Sample Input 1:**
```
my_first_class
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
MyFirstClass
```
**Sample Input 2:**
```
a
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
A
```
# Solution
```
print(''.join(map(str.title, input().lower().split('_'))))
```
