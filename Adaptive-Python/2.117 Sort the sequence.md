# Sort the sequence

Given the sequence of integers a[0 ... n-1] and the natural number kk, such that for any  i and j: if j≥i+k, than a[i]≤a[j]. Sort the sequence. The sequence can be very long. Time complexity: O(n * log(k)). Additional memory: O(k).

Input data
The first line contains number n, the second – a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} separated by a space and the last line contains number k. All numbers are integers.

Note Use merging.

**Sample Input:**

```
20
2 0 3 1 4 5 8 7 6 9 11 12 14 13 10 16 18 19 15 17
10
```
**Sample Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
```

# Solution
```
a = input()
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = input()
print(*sorted(b))
```
