# 2.42 Grades

Find the number of "Ds", "Cs", "Bs" and "As" for the last test on informatics in the class consisting of n students. The
program gets number n as input, and then gets the grades themselves (one by one). The program should output four numbers
in a single line - the number of "D", the number of "C", the number of "B" and the number of "A" grades.

**Sample Input:**

```

**Sample Output:**

```

```

# Solution

```
n = int(input())
dic = {'2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 0, '5': 0}
for i in range(n):
    dic[input()] += 1
print(*dic.values())
```
