# Sorting

Given an array of integers. You should sort it (in a non-decreasing order), and then for each element display its index
in the initial array (starting from 1).

For example, let's have an array 50 98 17 79 that should be sorted to 17 50 79 98. And now:

17 was a 3-rd element of the initial array
50 was a 1-st element
79 was a 4-th element
98 was a 2-nd element
Therefore the result will be 3 1 4 2.

**Input** contains the size of the array in the first line, and in the second line â€“ the elements of the array (
integers, space separated).

**Output** should contain the list of sorted elements' indices in the initial array; space separated.

**Sample Input:**

```
4
50 98 17 79
```

**Sample Output:**

```
3 1 4 2
```

# Solution

```
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
sort_arr = sorted(arr)
result = map(lambda x: arr.index(x) + 1, sort_arr)
print(*list(result))
```
