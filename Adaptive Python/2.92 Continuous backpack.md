# Continuous backpack

First line contain the number of items 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  and capacity of the backpack 0 ≤ W ≤ 2000000 
Each of the next nn lines specifies the cost 0 ≤ c ≤ 2000000 and volume 0 < w ≤ 2000000 of an item (n, W, c, w) — integers). Output the maximum cost of parts of the items (you can separate any part from each item, its cost and volume will decrease proportionally), placed in the backpack, with an accuracy of not less than three decimal places.

**Sample Input:**
```
3 50
60 20
100 50
120 30
```
**Sample Output:**
```
180.000
```
# Solution
```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
# m = 50, n = 3
stuff = sorted([list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)], key=lambda x: x[1])
# stuff = [[60, 20], [120, 30], [100,50]]
result_stuff = list(map(lambda x: (x[0] / x[1], x[0], x[1]), stuff))
# result_stuff = [(3.0, 60, 20), (4.0, 120, 30), (2.0, 100, 50)]
result1 = sorted(result_stuff, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
# result1 = [(4.0, 120, 30), (3.0, 60, 20), (2.0, 100, 50)]

summ, count = 0, 0
elements = []
for i in result1:
    for j in range(i[2]):
        elements.append(i[0])

for cennik in elements:
    if count >= m:
        pass
    else:
        summ += cennik
        count += 1
print(round(summ, 3))
